while I'm working on Edx course on data science, I find the notebook is a good choice for taking courses' notes.

I was using minikube for Docker desktop replacement before, however, now there is a much much better alternative [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/).

since I need to start the docker, run the image and copy and paste the token to access the notebook, it would be nice to have a short script to do all of these:

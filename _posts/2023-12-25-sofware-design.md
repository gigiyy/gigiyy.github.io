swift method is the high level design, product backlog is the median level and the coding is detailed one.

using swift method, you'll be able to complete first round in roughly 2 to 3 weeks, and start your detailed design in less than 4 weeks.

the iteration of parallelism and interleaving of backlog refinement and coding is the central part of software design processes. there'll be needs to re-visit the high level design but certainly it's significancy less so.

specifically, the testing code we can't emphasize enough is also the part of the design too. it's the validation part of design processes.

since all of these are designs, the manufacturing process is actually the CI/CD pipeline we created to help us get rid of this mundane labor, we all don't want to be the assembly line workers.

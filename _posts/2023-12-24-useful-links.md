some useful links that I visit frequently

- [should that be a microservice?](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/should-that-be-a-microservice-keep-these-six-factors-in-mind)

it's Matt's original idea on how to qualify the services. we usually use this as general guide line to looking for service candidates and qualify it later:

- [App Continuum](https://www.appcontinuum.io/) and its [deck](https://deck.appcontinuum.io/#0)

to evolve your codebase from its initial unorganized stages to independent microservices. don't spend too much time placing your source file around just like clean architecture did.

- [how they test](https://github.com/abhivaikar/howtheytest)

if you are wondering how tests were done out there.

- [code is design](https://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html)

certainly thoughtful and intriguing essays. for me, it explains well why swift methodology and XP/TDD works well together.

- [simple made easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4)

it's a talk by Rich Hickey, who is Clojure author. this talk definitely make you think how should you approach software design, which means coding.

- [zebras all the way down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE2KDzZaxvE)

Bryan Cantrill is one of his own kind. just need to remember our internet civilization lives on steal plates.

- [leaky abstractions by Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)

> So the abstractions save us time working, but they donâ€™t save us time learning.

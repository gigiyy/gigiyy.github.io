title: What a developer wants?
---

As I read Joel's post on the [developer abstraction layer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/04/11/the-development-abstraction-layer-2/), it struck me that this is what have been bugging me for the past few years.

Having been a developer for 23 years, I've often pondered what it takes to excel in my role. What are the keys to becoming a better developer?

It's not just about mastering programming languages or frameworks. It's about understanding the business requirements â€“ a lump sum term that I use for everything other than coding.

This involves understanding stuff such as:

- The nuanced details that dictate whether I should print "Hello world!" or "Hello, Mr. Zhu."
- Familiarity with external systems and how to effectively communicate with them, including the teams responsible for those systems.
- Knowing the intricacies of pipelines that determine how my code transforms into a functional binaries.
- Navigating through the various gates necessitated by the policy.
- Understanding the infrastructure landscape that dictates where my application can be deployed.

As Developer, I would love the developer platform that can minimize the overhead that caused by these aspects, particularly on those last three bullet points. It would be wonderful If it can also make the second easier.
